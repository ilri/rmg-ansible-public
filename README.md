# Ansible scripts for ILRI research-computing infrastructure
In order for these playbooks to work, your host must:

- have finished installation, have working networking, and an SSH daemon running
- have added a `provisioning` user via kickstart / preseed
- have an entry in the `private/hosts`
- have a var file in `host_vars/` which defines _at least_ an `ansible_host` variable

Assuming the above are true, you should be able to run these playbooks successfully.

## Post-install Ansible invocation
Take note that the first-ever invocation after the clean installation of a machine is different than subsequent invocations due to the way SSH public keys are copied to the host.

On the first run, you need to use `-k --ask-become-pass` to prompt for the SSH/sudo password of the provisioning user:

    $ ansible-playbook site.yml --limit=ilrinrb10 -k --ask-become-pass -t sshd,ssh-keys,sudoers

On subsequent runs, after SSH keys have been deployed, you only need `--ask-become-pass` for the sudo password of the provisioning user:

    $ ansible-playbook site.yml --limit=ilrinrb10 --ask-become-pass

## TODO

- Convention: replace all double quotes with single quotes where we don't need variable interpolation
- Update: sysctl.conf template for Ubuntu, using CentOS template as a reference
- Remove: rc.local task for Debian/Ubuntu, as it we are apparently not using it
- Update: make SSH rate limits configurable

# Glaring fucking hack: skip the firewall on linode20 and linode31 because they
# run Docker and Docker doesn't work with nftables. We also ignore holstein be-
# cause it is running libvirtd with the main interface on br0 and a bunch of
# virtual ethernet devices and I am not on site so can't fix it if I get locked
# out!
